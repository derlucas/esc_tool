ESC tool
=============


This is a GUI written using the Qt toolkit to configure ESC motor controllers.

This is based on Benjamin Vedders work (https://github.com/vedderb/vesc_tool).

This fork removes some unnecessary behaviour/stuff from the original Software
and makes it easier for others to use this great piece of software without
worrying about Trademark issues.



Changes to the original Software
----------------

  - removed all trademarked Logos
  - removed all trademarked Wording / Brand
  - removed the update-version online Check
  - removed the First-Start Wizard where you need to accept the warranty/disclaimer
  - changed the License information to be in the file COPYING


Happy further forking and using. Thanks Benjamin for your work.
